DeBaCode is a non-profit company that develops software for SMEs, social start-ups and NGOs in cooperation with Bosnian students.

We fight youth unemployment in Bosnia by offering living wages to junior student developers while training them at the same time.
Together we provide affordable digitization and promote both coding education and equal opportunities within Europe.
